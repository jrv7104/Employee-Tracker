This is an employee tracker that would ideally allow users to update their employee information. In addition to being able to add several employees at once using mySQL, there is a function to edit the database, whether it involves adding, deleting or changing an employee's information.

Most of the functions of this code does work. It currently allows users to view all employees, view all employees by department, view roles and add employees. One thing I would like for it to do one day with more work is to view all possible managers, remove employee and update employee role and manager.
