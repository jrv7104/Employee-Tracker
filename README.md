This is an employee tracker that would ideally allow users to update their employee information. In addition to being able to add several employees at once using mySQL, there is a function to edit the database, whether it involves adding, deleting or changing an employee's information.

You start by running the schema.sql file, then seed.sql file, then run node index.js. From there all of your options are presented to the user.

After a couple of attempts and some help, all of the functions now work. It feels great that all of the functions are now live.
